      <p className="mb-3">
      I love working in teams and am eager to contribute to a workplace where I can make a meaningful impact. I am actively pursuing a degree in 
    <span className="font-medium"> Accounting</span> at 
    <span className="font-medium"> California State University Dominguez Hills</span>, with an anticipated graduation in 
    <span className="font-medium"> June 2025</span>, and I look forward to pursuing my CPA after graduation. Currently, I work as a maritime security guard at the 
    <span className="font-medium"> Port of Los Angeles</span>, screening over 3,000 passengers daily. I am proficient in 
    <span className="font-medium"> Excel, Word, Access, PowerPoint, Outlook, and VS Code</span>, with extensive experience in file management using 
    <span className="font-medium"> OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Drive</span>. I have a passion for creating websites and have worked with 
    <span className="font-medium"> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Linux systems, and virtual machines</span>. My professional background includes over six months in Accounts Receivable and 
    Accounts Payable, where I managed financial data and invoices with Excel. I started as an intern and was later hired as Lead Accounts Receivable/Payable for the finance department.
    Additionally, I have over three years of experience as a security guard at the 
    Los Angeles Cruise Center, where I developed strong interpersonal skills. My experience also includes working in educational settings and supporting adults with special needs.
